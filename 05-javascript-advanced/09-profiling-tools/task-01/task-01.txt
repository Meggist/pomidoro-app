1 List of problems
 - slow hover animation
 - slow render during scrolling the page
 - disappearing info blocks during scroll
 
2 Analyzing
    
    For the first I checked performance. I found out that callbacks of event listeners work slow. Also I figured out that painting is slow

3 Solutions

3.1 Optimize event listeners
 - We should init const variables of scroll and coordinate block
 - Optimize loop by using interpolation, prefix increment and creating extra edge variable  
 - Replace 'InnerHTML' to 'textContent'
 - Delete changing styles into callbacks and implement style only in <style> tag
 - Use 'requestAnimationFrame' for optimize
    
3.2 Optimize painting
  - Replace 'border-shadow' to 'border' properties because first one is expensive
  - Replace 'border-radius' to clip-path property in hover class because first one is expensive
